<p align="center">A <b>extremely simple database editing extension</b> for the admin panel of Pterodactyl mainly made as a quick afternoon Blueprint extension. Developers can use this to develop their own extensions and modify database values on the fly.</p>

> **Important**
> This tool can be used by other administrators to break panels, insert sql injections and more. It's highly advised to not use this resource on product panels as that is a massive security concern.

No support provided and maintencance is not guaranteed. This is just a quick afternoon thing I made that is useful for me and people developing extensions.

To install this, drag the dbedit.blueprint file into your Pterodactyl folder and run `blueprint -install dbedit`.

Version 1.1 requires Blueprint `alpha-EV0` or later.
